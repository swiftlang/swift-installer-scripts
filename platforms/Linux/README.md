## Linux Packaging and Distribution

## Linux Packages (RPM/Deb)

Currently Swift on Linux is distributed via tarball and Docker, and
we would like to start supporting RPM and Debs officially on swift.org.
The goal is to provide a seamless install process for Swift on Linux by
utilizing the platformâ€™s native package manager (RPM/Deb).


* Step 1. Develop native packages / installers for the distributions
* Step 2. Offer the native packages / installers through swift.org
  * Support all officially supported Linux platforms
  * Code signed by swift.org certificate
  * Repository hosted on swift.org
* Step 3. Offer the native packages / installer through official repositories
for the various platforms
  * Work with official repositories to accept package specs
  * Deprecate swift.org packages / installer repository
* Step 4. Deprecate swift.org Linux tarballs

### Package Info

* Package name: swiftlang
* License: Apache 2.0
* Maintainer: swift-infrastructure@forums.swift.org
* URL: https://swift.org
* Description:
```
Swift is a general-purpose programming language built using
a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design
patterns.

The goal of the Swift project is to create the best available
language for uses ranging from systems programming, to mobile
and desktop apps, scaling up to cloud services. Most
importantly, Swift is designed to make writing and maintaining
correct programs easier for the developer.
```

### RPM Naming Convention:

Package naming convention: `swiftlang-<VERSION>-<RELEASE>.<DIST>.<ARCH>.rpm`  
Package structure: `/repo/<OS>/releases/<OS_VERSION>/<ARCH>/`  
Repository configuration: `/repo/<OS>/releases/<OS_VERSION>/swiftlang.repo`  


#### Example

* **Package structure:**  
```
/repo/centos/releases/8/x86_64/swiftlang-5.5.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm
/repo/centos/releases/8/aarch64/swiftlang-5.5.0-1.el8.aarch64.rpm
```

* **Package URL:**  
https://download.swift.org/repo/centos/releases/8/aarch64/swiftlang-5.5.0-1.el8.aarch64.rpm

* **Repository configuration file URL:**  
https://download.swift.org/repo/centos/releases/8/swiftlang.repo

## Open Questions

* Where should swiftlang be installed on the system?
	* Option 1: Diverge the install location between platform to best fit the platform requirements.
		* symlink the toolchain into /usr/ to avoid conflicting with llvm.org binaries.
	* Option 2: Install in /usr and rename llvm-project binaries (example: swift-lldb/lldb-swift ...)
	* [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/apple/swift-installer-scripts/pull/37#discussion_r726707320)
* Should we support multiple swiftlang versions on the system?
* Multiple packages:
	* swiftlang
	* swiftlang-runtime
